# Taskmanager

The app allows multiple programmers (instances of the program) to see a table containing tasks. Each tasks has a description, a status, id of the programmer assigned to it and the programmer's name. Open tasks can be assigned to a programmer (by clicking the start button on an open task). Once a task is in progress, the same programmer that started the task can finish/close it by clicking the 'done' button.

The app correctly displays changes to the table live, in sync with the rest of the open programs.

The programmer can also add/remove tasks from the table.
